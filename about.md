# üë©‚Äçüéì About Me

Hi, I'm Chloe! I'm a college sophomore studying electrical engineering at Temple University.  
I love exploring how technology can solve real-world problems and documenting my journey here.  

Outside of school, you can find me reading, traveling, and taking lots of pictures!

Starting in Fall 2025, I will take on new leadership and mentorship roles within my engineering community. I am excited to serve as a teacher‚Äôs assistant for the introductory engineering courses I completed last year, where I will support students as they build their foundational skills. In addition, I will step into the role of STARS Coordinator for the Society of Women Engineers, helping organize initiatives that foster growth and connection among members. This follows an impactful semester during which I was inducted into Theta Tau, the professional engineering fraternity, further expanding my involvement in the engineering field.
