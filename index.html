    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>About Me</p>
    <p>I'm a sophomore at Temple University majoring in electrical engineering. I am looking forward to studying abroad at the Temple University Rome campus in Spring 2026.
    </p>
     <p>I am developing my coding and problem-solving skills in school, and I have advanced time management and customer service skills from part-time work experience. I love to learn about circuits, coding, and photography!
    </p>
    <p>I am currently interested in gaining more experience for my major through available internships/work experience.
