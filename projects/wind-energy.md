# üå¨Ô∏è Wind Energy Analysis

This project analyzed wind data from six U.S. cities (Philadelphia, Mesa, Chicago, New Orleans, Springfield, Salt Lake City) to evaluate wind turbine viability at hub heights of 100m, 150m, and 200m.

**Key considerations:**
- Average monthly & yearly energy production
- 25-year profit modeling
- Operational hours
- Breakeven year for each turbine scenario

**What I Did:**
- Collected and cleaned wind speed data
- Built MATLAB models to simulate turbine performance
- Compared profitability of different hub heights

**Results:**
- Taller hub heights performed better in lower-wind regions  
- Profitability varied significantly by location, with the best sites breaking even in under 10 years.
