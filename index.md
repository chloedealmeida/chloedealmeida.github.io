# 👋 Hi, I'm Chloe!

Welcome to my portfolio site! This is a space where I share my projects, experiences, and what I'm learning along the way.

## 📝 About Me
I'm a college sophomore studying electrical engineering at Temple University.  
I love exploring how technology can solve real-world problems and documenting my journey here.  

Outside of school, you can find me reading, traveling, and taking lots of pictures!
